# README

Aug 1, 2020
  I will be making changes to the original group project on my own. Hope to clean-up the code a bit and refactor some of the chaos.
  Would like to add these features:
  
    1. Users show page  
      see all users in one place and be able to go to their profiles and collections
      
    2. Collection Page CRUD actions
      be able to add and remove pictures from a collection on the show page
      (see all users pictures at once and be able to select one or many to add or remove from collection)
      
    3. Click on comment icon to comment
      
  Fix these bugs: 
    
    1. Search functionality so that it loads correct number of results.
    
    2. Search query clears upon 
    
  Styling: 
  
    1. Home: Make the hero 50vh, and give it a max height of 750px
    
    2. Delete prompts on modals for Comments and Collections
    
    3. Add icons to comments and views on Card.js
    
    4. Add main icon to index.html
    
    5. Category Bar has l-r arrows that can be clicked on to scroll when content overflows
    
  Refactor Code:
  
    1. Convert to functional components (this is mainly for my practice, not really needed.)
    
    2. Icons -- place svg code in import, not inside .js files
    
  Add Admin Panel
  
    1. Add website traffic stats (I'm sure there's an api for this.)
    
    2. CRUD actions for Picture, Comment, Collection_Picture, Category, Collection
    
    3. Can create and edit all users 
    
    
 (I'm sure there are many more things, but this will be a good start)
